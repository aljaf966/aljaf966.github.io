  <h3>  Chapter I.  What a Book is  </h3>
  <p> <span class="bold"> A </span> book is a sequence of <span class="spaces"> spaces.</span> </p>
<p>  <span class="bold">E</span>ach of these spaces is perceived at a different moment - a book is also a sequence of  <a class"two" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrZi18BoomE">moments</a>.
 A book is <span class="not">not</span> a case of words, nor a bag of words, nor a bearer of words.
A writer, <span class="emphasis"> contrary to the popular opinion, </span> does not write books.</P>
<p><span class="bold">A </span> writer writes <span class="color1"> texts. </span> </P>
<p>The fact, that a text is <strong>contained</strong> in a book, comes only from the <span class="skew"> dimensions </span> of such a text; or, in the
case of a series of short texts (poems, for instance), from their number.</p>
<p>A literary (prose) text contained in a book ignores the fact that the book is an autonomous space-time
sequence.</p>
<p> A series of more or less short texts (poems or other) distributed through a book following any
particular ordering reveals the sequential nature of the book.</p>
<p>It reveals it, perhaps uses it; but it does not incorporate it or assimilate it.</p>
<p> Written language is a sequence of signs expanding within the space; the reading of which occurs in the
time. </P>
<p> A book is a space-time sequence. </p>
<p>Books existed originally as containers of (literary) texts.
But books, seen as autonomous realities, can contain any (written) language, not only literary language,
or even any other system of signs.
Among languages, literary language (prose and poetry) is not the best fitted to the nature of books<p>
</div>

  <div id="chapter2">
  <h3> Chapter II. Prose & Poetry </h3>
  <p>In an old book all the pages are the same.
When writing the text, the writer followed only the sequential laws of language, which are not the
sequential laws of books.</p>
<p>Words might be different on every page; but every page is, as such, identical with the preceding ones
and with those that follow.
In the new art every page is different; every page is an individualized element of a structure (the book)
wherein it has a particular function to fulfill.</p>
<p>In spoken and written language pronouns substitute for nouns, so to avoid tiresome, superfluous
repetitions.</P>
<p>In the book, composed of various elements, of signs, such as language, what is it that plays the role of
pronouns, so to avoid tiresome, superfluous repetitions?</P>
<p>his is a problem for the new art; the old one does not even suspect its existence.</P>
  <p>A book of 500 pages, or of 100 pages, or even of 25, wherein all the pages are similar, is a boring book
considered as a book, no matter how thrilling the content of the words of the text printed on the pages
might be.</P>
<p> A novel, by a writer of genius or by a third-rate author, is a book where nothing happens. </p>
<p>There are still, and always will be, people who like reading novels. There will also always be people who
like playing chess, gossiping, dancing the mambo, or eating strawberries with cream.</P>
<p> In comparison with novels, where nothing happens, in poetry books something happens sometimes,
although very little.</p>
<P>A novel with no capital letters, or with different letter types, or with chemical formulae interspersed
here and there etc., is still a novel, that is to say, a boring book pretending not to be such</P>
<P>A book of poems contains as many words as, or more than, a novel, but it uses ultimately the real,
physical space whereon these words appear, in a more intentional, more evident, deeper way.
This is so because in order to transcribe poetical language onto paper it is necessary to translate
typographically the conventions proper to poetic language.<P>
  <p>The transcription of prose needs few things: punctuation, capitals, various margins, etc.
All these conventions are original and extremely beautiful discoveries, but we don't notice them any
more because we use them daily.
Transcription of poetry, a more elaborate language, uses less common signs. The mere need to create
the signs fitting the transcription of poetic language, calls our attention to this very simple fact: to write
a poem on paper is a different action from writing it on our mind.<P>
  <p>Poems are songs, the poets repeat. But they don't sing them. They write them.
Poetry is to be said aloud, they repeat. But they don't say it aloud. They publish it.
The fact is, that poetry, as it occurs normally, is written and printed, not sung and spoken, poetry.
And with this, poetry has lost nothing.</P>
<p>On the contrary, poetry has gained something: a spatial reality that the so loudly lamented sung and
spoken poetries lacked.</P>
</div>
<div id="chapter3">
  <h3> Chapter 3: The Space </h3>
  <p>For years, many years, poets have intensively and efficiently exploited the spatial possibilities of poetry.
But only the so-called concrete or, later, visual poetry, has openly declared this. </p>

<p>Verses ending halfway on the page, verses having a wider or a narrower margin, verses being separated
from the following one by a bigger or smaller space - all this is exploitation of space.</p>

<p>This is not to say that a text is poetry because it uses space in this or that way, but that using space is a
characteristic of written poetry </p>

<p>The space is the music of the unsung poetry</P>

  <p>The introduction of space into poetry (or rather of poetry into space) is an enormous event of literally
incalculable consequences.</P>

<p> One of these consequences is concrete and/or visual poetry. Its birth is not an extravagant event in the
history of literature, but the natural, unavoidable development of the spatial reality gained by language
since the moment writing was invented.</P>

<P>The poetry of the old art does use space, albeit bashfully.
This poetry establishes an inter-subjective communication.
Inter-subjective communication occurs in an abstract, ideal, impalpable space</P>

<P>In the new art (of which concrete poetry is only an example) communication is still inter-subjective, but
it occurs in a concrete, real, physical space - the page.</P>

<p>A book is a volume in the space</P>

  <p> It is the true ground of the communication that takes place through words - its here and now.</p>

  <p>Concrete poetry represents an alternative to poetry.
Books, regarded as autonomous space-time sequences offer an alternative to all existent literary genres.</P>

<p>Space exists outside subjectivity.
If two subjects communicate in the space, then space is an element of this communication. Space
modifies this communication. Space imposes its own laws on this communication.
Printed words are imprisoned in the matter of the book. </p>

<P>What is more meaningful: the book or the text it contains?</P>

<p> What was first: the chicken or the egg? </p>

<p>The old art assumes that printed words are printed on an ideal space.
The new art knows that books exist as objects in an exterior reality, subject to concrete conditions of
perception, existence, exchange, consumption, use, etc. </p>

<p>The objective manifestation of language can be experienced in an isolated moment and space - the page;
or in a sequence of spaces and moments - the book.<p>

  <P>There is not and will not be new literature any more.</P>
<P> There will be, perhaps, new ways to communicate that will include language or will use language as a
basis. As a medium of communication, literature will always be old literature </p>
