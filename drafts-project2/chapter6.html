  <h3>  Chapter VI.  The Reading</h3>
  <p>In order to read the old art, knowing the alphabet is enough.</p>

<p> In order to read the new art one must apprehend the book as a structure, identifying its elements and
understanding their function.<p>

  <p> One might read old art in the belief that one understands it, and be wrong.
Such a misunderstanding is impossible in the new art. You can read only if you understand.</p>

<p> In the old art all books are read in the same way</p>

<p>In the new art every book requires a different reading.</p>


<p>In the old art, to read the last page takes as much time as to read the first one. </p>

<p>In the new art the reading rhythm changes, quickens, speeds up.</p>

<p> In order to understand and to appreciate a book of the old art, it is necessary to read it thoroughly.
In the new art you often do NOT need to read the whole book.</P>

<P>The reading may stop at the very moment you have understood the total structure of the book,
The new art makes it possible to read faster than the fast-reading methods. </p>

<p>There are fast-reading methods because writing methods are too slow.
To read a book, is to perceive sequentially its structure.</p>

<p>The old art takes no heed of reading.
The new art creates specific reading conditions. <P>

  <P>  The farthest the old art has come to, is to bring into account the readers, which is going too far.</p>

<p>The new art doesn't discriminate between its readers; it does not address itself to the book-addicts or
try to steal its public away from TV. </p>

<p>In order to be able to read the new art, and to understand it, you don't need to spend five years in a
Faculty of English. </p>

<p> In order to be appreciated, the books of the new art don't need the sentimental and/or intellectual
complicity of the readers in matters of love, politics, psychology, geography, etc. </p>

<p>The new art appeals to the ability every man possesses for understanding and creating signs and systems
of signs.</p>
