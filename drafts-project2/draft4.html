  <h3> Chapter I. WHAT A BOOK IS </h3>
  <p> A book is a sequence of <span class="spaces"> spaces.</span> </p>
<p> Each of these spaces is perceived at a different moment - a book is also a sequence of  <a class"two" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrZi18BoomE"> moments. </a>
A book is <span class="not"> not </span> a case of words, nor a bag of words, nor a bearer of words.
A writer, <span class="italic"> contrary to the popular opinion, </span> does not write books.</P>
<p>A writer writes texts.</P>
<p>The fact, that a text is contained in a book, comes only from the dimensions of such a text; or, in the
case of a series of short texts (poems, for instance), from their number.</p>
<p>A literary (prose) text contained in a book ignores the fact that the book is an autonomous space-time
sequence.</p>
<p> A series of more or less short texts (poems or other) distributed through a book following any
particular ordering reveals the sequential nature of the book.</p>
<p>It reveals it, perhaps uses it; but it does not incorporate it or assimilate it.</p>
