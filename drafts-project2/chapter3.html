  <h3> Chapter III: The Space </h3>
  <p>For years, many years, poets have intensively and efficiently exploited the spatial possibilities of poetry.
But only the so-called concrete or, later, <a class="one" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+poetry&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ8Zb96JLvAhXyMlkFHVE6D9oQ_AUoAXoECBkQAw&biw=1679&bih=849">visual</a> poetry, has openly declared this. </p>

<p>Verses ending halfway on the page, verses having a wider or a narrower margin, verses being separated
from the following one by a <span class="bigger"> bigger</span> or <span class="smaller"> smaller </span> space - all this is exploitation of space.</p>

<p>This is not to say that a text is poetry because it uses space in this or that way, but that using space is a
characteristic of written poetry </p>

<p>The space is the music of the unsung poetry</P>

  <p>The introduction of space into poetry (or rather of poetry into space) is an enormous event of literally
incalculable consequences.</P>

<p> One of these consequences is concrete and/or visual poetry. Its birth is not an extravagant event in the
history of literature, but the natural, unavoidable development of the spatial reality gained by language
since the moment writing was invented.</P>

<P>The poetry of the old art does use space, albeit bashfully.
This poetry establishes an inter-subjective communication.
Inter-subjective communication occurs in an abstract, ideal, impalpable space</P>

<P>In the new art (of which concrete poetry is only an example) communication is still inter-subjective, but
it occurs in a concrete, real, physical space - the page.</P>

<p>A book is a volume in the space</P>

  <p> It is the true ground of the communication that takes place through words - its here and now.</p>

  <p>Concrete poetry represents an alternative to poetry.
Books, regarded as autonomous space-time sequences offer an alternative to all existent literary genres.</P>

<p>Space exists outside subjectivity.
If two subjects communicate in the space, then space is an element of this communication. Space
modifies this communication. Space imposes its own laws on this communication.
Printed words are imprisoned in the matter of the book. </p>

<P>What is more meaningful: the book or the text it contains?</P>

<p> What was first: the chicken or the egg? </p>

<p>The old art assumes that printed words are printed on an ideal space.
The new art knows that books exist as objects in an exterior reality, subject to concrete conditions of
perception, existence, exchange, consumption, use, etc. </p>

<p>The objective manifestation of language can be experienced in an isolated moment and space - the page;
or in a sequence of spaces and moments - the book.<p>

  <P>There is not and will not be new literature any more.</P>
<P> There will be, perhaps, new ways to communicate that will include language or will use language as a
basis. As a medium of communication, literature will always be old literature </p>
