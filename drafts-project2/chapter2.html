  <h3> Chapter II. Prose & Poetry </h3>
  <p>In an <span class="old">old</span> book all the pages are the same.
When writing the text, the writer followed only the sequential <span class="laws">laws of language</span>, which are not the
sequential laws of books.</p>
<p>Words might be different on every page; <span class="but">but</span> every page is, as such, identical with the preceding ones
and with those that follow.
In the new art every page is different; every page is an individualized element of a structure (the book)
wherein it has a particular function to fulfill.</p>
<p>In spoken and written language pronouns substitute for nouns, so to avoid tiresome, <a class="one" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superfluous">superfluous</a>
repetitions.</P>
<p>In the book, composed of various elements, of signs, such as language, what is it that plays the role of
pronouns, so to avoid tiresome, superfluous repetitions?</P>
<p>This is a problem for the new art; the old one does not even suspect its existence.</P>
  <p>A book of 500 pages, or of 100 pages, or even of 25, wherein all the pages are similar, is a boring book
considered as a book, no matter how <span class="thrilling">thrilling</span> the content of the words of the text printed on the pages
might be.</P>
<p> A novel, by a writer of genius or by a third-rate author, is a book where nothing happens. </p>
<p>There are still, and always will be, people who like reading novels. There will also always be people who
like playing <a class="two" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDrieqwSdgI">chess,</a> gossiping, dancing the <a class="three" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXpnuyqloKU">mambo</a>, or eating <span class="strawberry">strawberries with cream.</span></P>
<p> In comparison with novels, where nothing happens, in poetry books something happens sometimes,
although very little.</p>
<P>A novel with no <span class="capital">capital</span> letters, or with different letter types, or with chemical formulae interspersed
here and there etc., is still a novel, that is to say, a boring book pretending not to be such</P>
<P>A book of poems contains as many words as, or more than, a novel, but it uses ultimately the real,
physical space whereon these words <span class="appear">appear</span>, in a more intentional, more evident, <span class="deeper">deeper</span> way.
This is so because in order to transcribe poetical language onto paper it is necessary to translate
typographically the conventions proper to poetic language.<P>
  <p>The transcription of prose needs few things: punctuation, capitals, various margins, etc.
All these conventions are original and extremely beautiful discoveries, but we don't notice them any
more because we use them daily.
Transcription of poetry, a more elaborate language, uses less common signs. The mere need to create
the signs fitting the transcription of poetic language, calls our attention to this very simple fact: to write
a poem on paper is a different action from writing it on our mind.<P>
  <p>Poems are songs, the poets repeat. But they don't sing them. They write them.
Poetry is to be said aloud, they repeat. But they don't say it aloud. They publish it.
The fact is, that poetry, as it occurs normally, is written and printed, not sung and spoken, poetry.
And with this, poetry has lost nothing.</P>
<p>On the contrary, poetry has gained something: a spatial reality that the so loudly lamented sung and
spoken poetries lacked.</P>
