  <h3>  Chapter IV.  The Language</h3>
  <p>Language transmits ideas, i.e. mental images.</p>
<p> The starting point of the transmission of mental images is always an intention: we speak to transmit a
particular image.<p>

  <p> The everyday language and the old art language have this in common: both are intentional, both want to
transmit certain mental images </p>

<p> In the old art the meanings of the words are the bearers of the author's intentions.
Just as the ultimate meaning of words is indefinable, so the author's intention is unfathomable</p>
<p> Every intention presupposes a purpose, a utility.</p>


<p> Everyday language is intentional, that is, utilitarian; its function is to transmit ideas and feelings, to
explain, to declare, to convince, to invoke, to accuse, etc. </p>

<p> Old art's language is intentional as well, i.e. utilitarian. Both languages differ from one another only in
their exterior form.</p>

<p> New art's language is radically different from daily language. It neglects intentions and utility, and it
returns to itself, it investigates itself, looking for forms, for series of forms that give birth to, couple
with, unfold into, space-time sequences.</P>

<P> The words in a new book are not the bearers of the message, nor the mouthpieces of the soul, nor the
currency of communication. </p>

<p>Those were already named by Hamlet, an avid reader of books: words, words, words.</p>

<p> The words of the new book are there not to transmit certain mental images with a certain intention.
They are there to form, together with other signs, a space-time sequence that we identify with the name
'book'.<P>

  <P> The words in a new book might be the author's own words or someone else's words.
A writer of the new art writes very little or does not write at all </p>

<p> The most beautiful and perfect book in the world is a book with only blank pages, in the same way that
the most complete language is that which lies beyond all that the words of a man can say.</p>

<p> Every book of the new art is searching after that book of absolute whiteness, in the same way that every
poem searches for silence.</p>

<p> Intention is the mother of rhetoric. </p>

<p> Words cannot avoid meaning something, but they can be divested of intentionality</p>

<p>A non-intentional language is an abstract language: it doesn't refer to any concrete reality.
Paradox: in order to be able to manifest itself concretely, language must first become abstract.</p>

<P> Abstract language means that words are not bound to any particular intention; that the word 'rose' is
neither the rose that I see nor the rose that a more or less fictional character claims to see.
In the abstract language of the new art the word 'rose' is the word 'rose'. It means all the roses and it
means none of them.</P>

<p> How to succeed in making a rose that is not my rose, nor his rose, but everybody's rose, i.e. nobody's
rose?</P>

<p> By placing it within a sequential structure (for example a book), so that it momentarily ceases being a
rose and becomes essentially an element of the structure. </P>
