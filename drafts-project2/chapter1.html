  <h3>  Chapter I.  What a Book is  </h3>
  <p> <span class="bold"> A</span> book is a sequence of <span class="spaces"> spaces.</span> </p>
<p>  <span class="bold">E</span>ach of these spaces is perceived at a different moment - a book is also a sequence of  <a class"two" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrZi18BoomE"> moments. </a>
 A book is <span class="not"> not </span> a case of words, nor a bag of words, nor a bearer of words.
A writer, <span class="emphasis"> contrary to the popular opinion, </span> does not write books.</P>
<p><span class="bold">A </span> writer writes <span class="color1"> texts. </span> </P>
<p>The fact, that a text is <strong>contained</strong> in a book, comes only from the <span class="dimensions">dimensions</span> of such a text; or, in the
case of a series of short texts (poems, for instance), from their number.</p>
<p>A literary (prose) text contained in a book <span class="ignores">ignores</span> the fact that the book is an autonomous <span class="spacetime">space-time</span>
sequence.</p>
<p> A series of more or less short texts (poems or other) distributed through a book following any
particular ordering reveals the sequential nature of the book.</p>
<p>It reveals it, perhaps uses it; but it does not incorporate it or <a class="three" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assimilate">assimilate</a> it.</p>
<p> <span class="written">Written</span> language is a sequence of signs expanding within the space; the reading of which occurs in the
time. </P>
<p> A book is a <span class="spacetime">space-time</span> sequence. </p>
<p>Books existed originally as containers of (literary) texts.
But books, seen as autonomous realities, can contain any (written) language, not only literary language,
or even any other system of signs.
Among languages, literary language (prose and poetry) is not the best fitted to the nature of books<p>
