  <h3>  Chapter V.  Structures</h3>
  <p>Every word exists as an element of a structure - a phrase, a novel, a telegram.</p>
<p> Or: every word is part of a text.<p>
  <p> Nobody or nothing exists in isolation: everything is an element of a structure.
Every structure is in its turn an element of another structure.
Everything that exists is a structure.
To understand something, is to understand the structure of which it is a part and/or the elements
forming the structure that that something is.
A book consists of various elements, one of which might be a text.
A text that is part of a book isn't necessarily the most essential or important part of that book. </p>
<p> A person may go to the bookshop to buy ten red books because this colour harmonises with the other
colours in his sitting room, or for any other reason, thereby revealing the irrefutable fact, that books
have a colour.</p>
<p> In a book of the old art words transmit the author's intention. That's why he chooses them carefully.
In a book of the new art words don't transmit any intention; they're used to form a text which is an
element of a book, and it is this book, as a totality, that transmits the author's intention.</p>
<p> Plagiarism is the starting point of the creative activity in the new art.</p>
<p> Whenever the new art uses an isolated word, then it is in an absolute isolation: books of one single
word.</p>
<p> Old art's authors have the gift for language, the talent for language, the ease for language.
For new art's authors language is an enigma, a problem; the book hints at ways to solve it.</P>
<P> In the old art you write 'I love you' thinking that this phrase means 'I love you'.
(But: what does 'I love you' mean?). </p>
<p>In the new art you write 'I love you' being aware that we don't know what this means. You write this
phrase as part of a text wherein to write 'I hate you' would come to the same thing.
The important thing is, that this phrase, 'I love you' or 'I hate you', performs a certain ffunction as a text
within the structure of the book,</p>
<p> In the new art you don't love anybody.<P>
  <P> The old art claims to love. </p>
<p> In art you can love nobody. Only in real life can you love someone.</p>
<p> Not that the new art lacks passions.</p>
<p> All of it is blood flowing out of the wound that language has inflicted on men. </p>
<p> And it is also the joy of being able to express something with everything, with any thing, with almost
nothing, with nothing </p>
<p>The old art chooses, among the literary genres and forms, that one which best fits the author's
intention.
The new art uses any manifestation of language, since the author has no other intention than to test the
language's ability to mean something.</p>
<P> The text of a book in the new art can be a novel as well as a single word, sonnets as well as jokes, loveletters as well as weather reports.</P>
<p> In the old art, just as the author's intention is ultimately unfathomable and the sense of his words
indefinable, so the understanding of the reader is unquantifiable.
In the new art the reading itself proves that the reader understands.</P>
