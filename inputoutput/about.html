    <p class="about"> REMINDERS4U was created as a site to encourage those who may need some uplifting and reminders when being stuck in a dark place. There have been several times I wish I was told something but maybe nessecarily from anyone specfic; this website is for my sister and my friends who suffer from anxiety and aren't reminded enough that everything is going to be okay and you are right where you need to be. </p>
