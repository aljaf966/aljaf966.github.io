<p> As the story contains frequent conversations, and revolves around group settings/dialouge, telling the story via Imessege allows for quick back & forth communication as well as seperation in detail conversations between different characters.</P>

<h3> <a href="instagramstory.html"> Instagram <a/> </h3>
<p>Bateman is a classic narcissist who is obsessed with his looks to the outside, Instagram is a platform that breeds and feeds off of narcissism as it allows people to display and flaunt every aspect of their lives. The story told on instagram allows it ot be shown from only Bateman's POV and what he chooses to filter and show the world. </P>
