    <title>WHAT A BOOK IS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>A book is a sequence of spaces.
Each of these spaces is perceived at a different moment - a book is also a sequence of moments.
A book is not a case of words, nor a bag of words, nor a bearer of words. </p>

<p>A writer, contrary to the popular opinion, does not write books. </p>

<P>A writer writes texts.</P>
<p>The fact, that a text is contained in a book, comes only from the dimensions of such a text; or, in the
case of a series of short texts (poems, for instance), from their number. </P>
