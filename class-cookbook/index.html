<h3 id="headers2"> Ingredients </h3>

<ul class="lists" >
  <li>2-3 tablespoons olive oil (plus a drizzle more for serving)<li>
<li>2 pints cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>8oz block feta cheese</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
<li>Red chili pepper flakes, to taste </li>
<li> Dried oregano to taste, </li>
<li> 1 head garlic, with the top sliced off to reveal all the cloves </li>
<li> A drizzle of honey </li>
<li> 1 pound short pasta such as orecchiette, shells, or radiatore <li>
<li> Small bunch of fresh basil leaves </li>
<li> The zest of 1 lemon </li>
<li> Parmigiano reggiano or shredded mozzarella (to sprinkle on top, to taste)</li>
<li> 2 large handfuls panko bread crumbs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="headers2"> Method </h3>
<ol class="lists">
<li> Preheat the oven to 400Â° F. </li>
<li> In a 9x13" casserole dish (or something of a similar size), pour in 2-3 tbsps olive oil. Add the tomatoes and arrange the feta block in the center. Season with black pepper, red chili flakes, dried oregano. Add in the garlic head and drizzle with honey.  Place in oven and set a time for 40 minutes.  </li>
<li>Meanwhile, get a pot of boiling water going for the pasta. Start cooking it when there are about 7-8 minutes left on the tomatoes. Right before the pasta is almost "al dente", use a mug to reserve pasta water and drain. </li>
<li> Take out the tomatoes and feta when the tomatoes are nicely blistered and burst and the feta is lightly browned on top. Use tongs to squish out the garlic (and fork to smash the individual cloves), and mix the feta together with the tomatoes. Add torn basil, lemon zest, and cooked pasta. </li>
<li>Mix everything together with a few dashes of reserved pasta water just to moisten everything and meld the flavors. Sprinkle with parmigiano reggiano (or mozz) and panko. Return to the oven until lightly golden (broil if desired).</li>
